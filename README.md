# Local Connector

## The App

Local Connector is an app that allows people to connect to their local communities.
I wanted to make an app where people could make posts and see whats going on in their local communities.

## Backstory

Originally wanted to make an app that allowed people to connect to their local areas for Hack UMass.
We ended up completing the project, but a Database issue at the end along with general tiredness made 
me pretty demotivated towards the end.

After HackUMass was over I decided to redo the project to what I had envisioned because I felt as though
I had failed making the project live up to what it was supposed to be.

## Stack

- [Bun](https://bun.sh)
- [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com)
- [SQLite](http://sqlite.org)
- [HTMX](https://htmx.org)

### Reasonings

Bun: I used it for the first time during the Hackathon and very much liked it. Not having to install all of the typescript tooling is also pretty nice.

SQLite: Very simple and easy to work with database pretty stable too.

Elysia: I had used Hono previously, and wanted to see what the other backend framework was like. It also seemed like Elysia had more features.

HTMX: Makes development feel smooth and easy. Its a very simple library that cuts out more frontend code than I could imagine.
